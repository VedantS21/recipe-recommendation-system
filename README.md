##  [CSC722: Advanced Topics in Machine Learning Project] Recipe Recommendation System
# Project Goal: 
Data-driven recipe recommendation system using web-scraped recipe data (including but not limited to data like ingredients, health facts, etc.) and userâ€™s historical preference.
# Motivation:
Cooking is a hobby for some and a major problem for others. However, you can always use a helping hand for cooking. Being a student, it is always a difficult decision to decide what to eat for lunch or dinner. Sometimes faced with limited items in the kitchen, it is always a challenge to decide what to cook for meal. This inspired us to create a system that can recommend recipes based on ingredient suggestions.
